# Document_review_ethereum

A demo smart contract for document review on Ethereum

Testing and running the demo:

1. Install Node.js (for npm, npm version 5.1.0 or above is needed for following steps)

2. Download the repo

3. Install all packages:

```
npm install
```

4. Test the contract(locally):

```
npm test
```

5. Run the demo in a web3 capable browser (eg. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)). Note: This demo runs on Rinkeby test network, you need to have some toy Ether in order to run this demo. (You may get toy Ether from the [Rinkeby faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/).)
```
npm start run
```
Demo should now run on http://localhost:3000
